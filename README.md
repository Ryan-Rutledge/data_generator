# data_generator
Arbitrary data generation library

## Grammar

Data Generator provides a grammar parser that can be used to generate strings from a source file.

### Run Data Generator

```bash
python -m data_generator source.txt
```

### Randomizer Declarations

Randomizers can be created by providing a name and content:

```
STR_ONE
This is a string

STR_TWO
This is another string
```

### Output

Output of the source file is designated with the `__OUTPUT__` randomizer:

```
__OUTPUT__
This string will print when data_generator is executed.
```

### Strings

Strings are either short (single lines with whitespace stripped), or long (interpreted literally, including whitespace and newlines). Long strings begin on a new line and are denoted with a pipe at the beginning of each line.

```
SHORT_STRING
   This is a short string. Extra spaces at the start will be removed.

LONG_STRING
|This is a long string.
|  Extra spaces at the beginning will be included.
|    Only the pipe delimiters will be removed.
```


### Lists

Lists are sets of strings that randomly return one item at a time.

```
LIST_RANDOMIZER
- First item
- Second item
-
|Third item
|containing multiple lines
- Fourth item
```

### Callers

#### Syntax: `{RANDOMIZER}`

Callers function as placeholders for randomizers. Any time a caller is included in a string, the randomizer is executed and the placeholder is changed to the output of the randomizer.

```
COUNT
- ten
- twenty
- thirty

__OUTPUT__
|I have {COUNT} dollars.
|You have {COUNT} dollars.

```

### Pointers

#### Syntax: `{<RANDOMIZER}`

Pointers are very similar to callers, except that they do not generate additional content. Instead, they return the same value previously generated by the referenced randomizer.

```
COUNT
- ten
- twenty
- thirty

__OUTPUT__
|I have {COUNT} dollars.
|Again, I have {<COUNT} dollars.
```

### Repeaters

#### Syntax: `digit*string`

Repeaters allow content to be generated multiple times.

```
__OUTPUT__
5*This string will repeat five times.

```
